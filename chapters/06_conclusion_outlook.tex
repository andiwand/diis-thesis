% TODO "small" dmft calculations converge similar but a bit slower
% TODO "big" dmft calculations might benefit more -> further testing

% TODO noise might be a problem for DIIS (comparing qmc vs symmetry thing)
% TODO -> weighted least squares to handle qmc noise
% TODO -> svd to cut-off noise

% TODO anderson mixing?

% TODO link section?
As mentioned in the DIIS section, the algorithm can be interpreted as a regression. Since there are a lot of different regression techniques, especially in the field of machine learing, it might be interesting to try them. Besides that, the mixing algorithm could take advantage of incorporating prior knowledge from previous calculations.
