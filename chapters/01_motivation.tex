Pulay's direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS) method is one of the most widely used mixing schemes for accelerating the self-consistent solution of electronic structure problems.

CPU time is the currency in cluster computing.

The dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) self-consistency iterations with DIIS could to convergence, where it does not without mixing.
DIIS could accelerate the rate of convergence which results in smaller cost and wait time.
