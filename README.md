# DIIS mixing of self energy in DMFT

## Abstract

Dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) self-consistency iterations involve high computational efford which results in high costs. Pulayâ€™s direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS) method is one of the most widely used mixing schemes for accelerating the self-consistent solution of electronic structure problems. Goal of this project was to implement DIIS in the self-consistency cycle of w2dynamic and to benchmark the results by the rate of convergence.
